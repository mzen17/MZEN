    I am highly interested in systems & networks at higher (MS/PhD) education. I have essentially completed my bachelors in computer science, and am currently pursuing graduate classes, research, and independent studies.
    In addition, I am a researcher at the University of Iowa Hydroinformatics Laboratory, where I contribute to a remote sensing software system.
