    I am Mike Zeng, a senior at Iowa City West High and dual-enrolled at University of Iowa. I have 
    a strong interest in network systems and artificial intelligence, particularly their applications in context
    of society. In the meantime, I enjoy doing art, particularly 3D art with Blender.

    <h1 class = "text-2xl"> About </h1>
    I have substantial background, having taken all required undergraduate CS classes at UIowa. I am currently pursuing computer science 
    further through graduate classes and independent studies, most which concern to fields of networks 
    and deep learning.

    In addition, I am a researcher at the University of Iowa Hydroinformatics Laboratory, where I contribute to a remote sensing software system.
