# MZEN

![Logo](resource/MZEN.svg)

This is my personal website, built from scratch with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a bit of javascript.
I built it when I wasn't that experienced with javascript, so I'll probably rebuild my entire website from scratch sometimes later.

Unfortunately, it does not have a command to start, such as `npm` or something.

Expect the remake in around June 2023, after my AP exams and college finals.
